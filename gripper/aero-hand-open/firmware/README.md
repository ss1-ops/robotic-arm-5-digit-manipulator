# Aero Hand Open Firmware v0.1.0 — README

A reference guide for building, flashing, using, and extending the **Aero Hand Open** firmware that runs on an ESP32‑S3 (Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3) and drives Feetech smart servos - Feetech HLS3606M.

**Note:** If you do not need advanced control over the actuator, you only need the `.bin` file from this repository. You can download the bin files from the `main/bin` folder , and use the GUI to upload them to your device. We recommend using the [aero-open-sdk](https://github.com/TetherIA/aero-hand-open/tree/main/sdk) to upload the firmware by running the `aero-open-gui`.

## 1) Overview

The firmware exposes a compact **fixed 16‑byte binary serial protocol** so a host PC can command finger positions and query telemetry while the device handles **homing**, calibration, and basic safety on‑board.

**Major components**
- **`firmware_v0.1.0.ino`** — Main sketch: hardware init, serial command parser, periodic tasks, and command handlers.
- **`HandConfig.h`** — **Defines LEFT_HAND or RIGHT_HAND** (build‑time) to select the correct baseline calibration and channel directions.
- **`Homing.h` / `Homing.cpp`** — Implements the **homing** routine (`HOMING_start()` / `HOMING_isBusy()`), plus baseline tables and helpers.

**Servos / channels** (7):
1. Thumb CMC Abduction
2. Thumb CMC Flexion
3. Thumb Tendon (thumb curl/tendon drive)
4. Index
5. Middle
6. Ring
7. Pinky

## 3) Hardware & Software 

- **MCU**: Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32‑S3 (8 MB flash recommended)
- **Servos**: Feetech HLS3606M (IDs mapped to the 7 joints)
- **Power**: Power Servo rail at 6 with adequate current (Max Current up to 10A) , separate from USB 5 V
- **Tools**: [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/) or PlatformIO.

---

## 4) Quick Start

### A. Select LEFT or RIGHT hand
In `HandConfig.h`, **define exactly one** of the following macros, or pass a build flag (see §6):
```c++
// #define LEFT_HAND
#define RIGHT_HAND
```

The choice selects the correct baseline calibration table at build time.

### B. Build & Flash
- **PlatformIO**: On your Visual Studio Code, Once you install the platformIO, Restart your Visual studio Code. You will now see a icon on the left for PlatformIO as below.
![alt text](./main/assets/platformio.png)


Once You Reach here, You can press on create a new project . Once you click , It will ask you to enter the Project name and settings, Feel free to choose your desired location and project name,But keep Framework as Arduino and Board as Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3.

![alt text](./main/assets/platformioproject.png)


Now it will open the folder with a `platformio.ini` file. You might need to add a location where you have the FTServo library.  You can use build_flags to build it for the right or left hand. You need to copy paste over the ``firmware_v0.1.0.ino`` file in the ``main.cpp`` and you also need the header and cpp files under src directory as in the below given image.


![alt text](./main/assets/platformioini.png)


Now, You again need to go back to that build and upload page by pressing the PlatformIO icon. Here you can see an upload , Once you press the upload button, It should compile your files and upload it.
![alt text](./main/assets/platformioupload.png)


On successful upload, You will see some logs in your terminal window like in the image below.
![alt text](./main/assets/platformiologs.png)


- **Arduino IDE**: open `firmware_v0.1.0.ino`, set Board to *XIAO ESP32S3*, then **Upload**.  
  **Note:** If you are using the Arduino IDE for the first time, you may need to install the ESP32 board support. Go to the Board Manager by pressing Ctrl+Shift+B, then search for "esp32". Find "esp32 by Espressif Systems" and install it. After installation, change the board under the Tools menu and select "XIAO_ESP32S3" from the list.

### C. First Boot
1. Connect USB, open a serial monitor at the project baud rate (e.g., 1,000,000 or 115,200 as configured - default 921600).
2. On Pressing Reset, Using the Serial monitor make sure that you receive OK from all 7 Servos.

---

## 5) Firmware Architecture

### 5.1 Data structures
- **`ServoData`**: per‑channel configuration `{grasp_count, extend_count, servo_direction}` used to map 16‑bit host commands into per‑servo raw counts (0..4095).
- **Baselines**: compile‑time constants for LEFT and RIGHT hands (7 entries each). A runtime working copy `sd[7]` is initialized from whichever baseline the build selects.

### 5.2 Homing module
- **`HOMING_start()`**: runs the homing routine for all 7 servos.
- **`HOMING_isBusy()`**: returns true while homing is in progress.
- **`resetSdToBaseline()`**: copies the correct baseline into the working array before homing.

### 5.3 Main loop
The main loop performs:
- USB serial polling
- Fast‑path command decode (see §7)
- Optional periodic telemetry sampling and printing

---

## 6) Selecting LEFT vs RIGHT Hand at Build Time

You can switch hands either by editing `HandConfig.h` **or** using build flags.

- **PlatformIO** (`platformio.ini`):
- lib_extra_dirs point to the location where you might need the [FTServo_libraries](https://github.com/ftservo/FTServo_Arduino/tree/main).
- You need to comment both macros of #define LEFT_HAND and #define RIGHT_HAND in ``HandConfig.h``.
- build_flags will help you to build it for the right hand.
  ```ini
  [env:seeed_xiao_esp32s3]
  platform = espressif32
  board = seeed_xiao_esp32s3
  framework = arduino
  lib_extra_dirs = ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries
  build_flags= -DRIGHT_HAND
  ```

- **Arduino IDE**: temporarily uncomment the macro in `HandConfig.h`.

> **Tip:** Keep the default checked into version control (usually `RIGHT_HAND`) and apply overrides via build flags in CI or per‑developer settings.

Control Modes Note: 
> **Recommendation:** We recommend using position control for typical grasping tasks. Advanced users may use torque control mode, but only when the hand is in a position to grab an object. At higher torque values, if any servo exceeds an internal temperature of 80°C, it may temporarily ignore commands as a safety measure until it cools down.
> **Note:** Torque control is currently implemented in one direction only: from fully open to fully close.

**7.2 Channel Map (0..6)**

0: Thumb CMC Abduction
1: Thumb CMC Flexion
2: Thumb Tendon (curl)
3: Index Finger
4: Middle Finger
5: Ring Finger
6: Pinky Finger 

**7.3 Position Mapping (host 16-bit → servo raw count)**

For each channel i, map host value u16[i] ∈ [0..65535] into raw servo counts using per-channel calibration:

span   = grasp_count[i] - extend_count[i]          // can be ±
raw32  = extend_count[i] + (u16[i] * span) / 65535
raw    = clamp(raw32, 0, 4095)

Direction is handled via servo_direction. Final writes use bus-batched SyncWrite (e.g., SyncWritePosEx) for all 7 servos.

**7.4 Persistence, Homing & Timing**

TRIM updates the extend endpoint for one channel and saves it in NVS (persists across reboots).

HOMING:

Loads baseline tables (LEFT/RIGHT per build flag).

Drives each joint to contact (current-based) to re-establish the open/extend reference.

Blocking: Other commands are ignored until homing finishes and the ACK is issued.

Typical full sequence can take up to ~25 seconds per channel (mechanics-dependent).

GUI “Set to Extend” is a function that sends CTRL_POS with all channels at extend (open). It’s not a separate opcode.

**7.5 Example Frames**

Homing (host→device, then device→host ACK):

```Payload
TX: 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
RX: 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
```

Set ID to 0x0003, current limit 1023 (0x03FF):
```Payload
TX: 02 00 03 00 FF 03 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
RX: 02 00 oldId_lo oldId_hi 03 00 FF 03 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
```

Trim channel 3 by −100° (0xFF9C):
```Payload
TX: 03 00 03 00 9C FF 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
RX: 03 00 03 00 ext_lo ext_hi 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
```

CTRL_POS (7 channels). Example: all open (0):
```Payload
TX: 11 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
(no ACK)
```

GET_TEMP → returns 7×u16 temps:
``` Payload
TX: 25 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
RX: 25 00 t0_lo t0_hi t1_lo t1_hi ... t6_lo t6_hi
```

**7.6 Bus Access & Robustness**

All sync-read/write paths use a semaphore (e.g., gBusMux) for bus locking to avoid collisions.

Unknown/invalid opcodes are safely ignored to preserve frame alignment.

During HOMING, handlers ignore incoming writes; queue them on the host side.

**7.7 Practical Tips**

Use modest rates (e.g., 50 Hz) for CTRL_POS during validation.

Ensure the servo supply can deliver peak current without droop.

If motion looks inverted, swap extend_count/grasp_count or adjust servo_direction.

To revert large trims, re-run HOMING to restore baselines.

---

## 8) Homing Behavior

The homing routine:
1. Loads the correct baseline via `resetSdToBaseline()`.
2. For each servo, **slowly drives towards a mechanical stop** while monitoring current (a “zero with current” approach).
3. Calibrates offset at contact, performs a small back‑off/settling motion, and finally moves to a defined **extend** posture for consistency across boots.

Timing, current limits, and per‑servo special cases (e.g., thumb tendon) are enforced internally to reduce stress on the mechanism.

> You can safely call `HOMING_start()` at any time from the serial command handler. While homing, ignore position writes or buffer them on the host side.

---

## 9) Extending the Firmware with a New Command

When you want to add a new feature (e.g., LED blink, torque enable/disable, save trim, etc.), follow this pattern:

### Step 1 — Add a new **control byte** (opcode)
At the top of `firmware_v0.1.0.ino`, define a unique `#define` or `static const uint8_t` value not already in use.
```c++
// Example: a simple LED or debug action
static const uint8_t OP_BLINK = 0x42;   // choose a free byte
```

### Step 2 — Implement a handler function
Keep the switch‑case light by moving logic into a small function.
```c++
static void handleBlink(uint8_t count) {
  for (uint8_t i = 0; i < count; ++i) {
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
    delay(80);
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
    delay(80);
  }
}
```

### Step 3 — Add a `case` in the serial parser
Consume the payload as per use and call the function as per your handler.
```c++
case OP_BLINK: {
  uint8_t count = buf[1];                 // interpret first payload byte
  handleBlink(count);
  break;
}
```

### Step 4 — (Optional) Add a response
If the command should acknowledge or return data, write a 16‑byte response using the same framing convention (byte 0 = response opcode, byte 1 = 0x00, bytes 2..15 = payload).

### Step 5 — Update host tools
If you plan to use our aero-open-hand sdk then you might need to add that functionality under aero_hand.py file.

> **Naming tip:** Use `OP_*` for commands initiated by the host and `RX_*` or `OP_RSP_*` for device responses to avoid confusion.

## 10) Code Reference (quick lookup)

### Homing API
```c++
bool HOMING_isBusy();
void HOMING_start();
void resetSdToBaseline();
```

### Servo configuration
```c++
struct ServoData {     // one per channel
  uint16_t grasp_count;    // closed endpoint (raw 0..4095)
  uint16_t extend_count;   // open endpoint  (raw 0..4095)
  int8_t   servo_direction; // +1 or -1 direction convention
};
```

### Build‑time hand selection
```c++
// In HandConfig.h: define exactly one
// #define LEFT_HAND
// #define RIGHT_HAND
```

---

## 11) Safety & Best Practices
- Start with **low speeds/torque** when testing new code.
- Ensure the servo supply can deliver peak current without large droops.
- Keep cable lengths short and bus terminations clean; avoid ground loops.
- Avoid sending high‑rate position frames during homing.

---

## 12) Troubleshooting
- **Wrong hand geometry**: Verify your build flags (`-DLEFT_HAND` vs `-DRIGHT_HAND`).
- **Servos drive the wrong way**: Check `servo_direction` for the affected channel or swap extend/grasp counts.
- **Homing stalls**: Inspect current limits/timeouts; make sure mechanics move freely.
- **No serial activity**: Confirm port, baud rate, and that frames are exactly 16 bytes with the correct opcode.
