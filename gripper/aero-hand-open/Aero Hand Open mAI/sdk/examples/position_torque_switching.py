    # We recommend adjusting the time.sleep() values to change the speed of movements and torque variations as per your requirements and to observe the effects clearly.
    # We recommend to use switching only when necessary as frequent switching may lead to unexpected behavior and if the hand is not responding as expected, please restart the program and try to do homing before switching modes.
